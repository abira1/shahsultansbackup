        passage: `The process of language acquisition has been a subject of study for centuries. Modern research indicates that there are several stages through which children typically progress as they learn to speak any language.

The first stage, known as the pre-linguistic stage, occurs from birth to about 12 months. During this period, infants begin by producing cooing sounds, followed by babbling where they experiment with different speech sounds. By around 8 months, their babbling begins to sound more like the language they're exposed to.

The second stage, from approximately 12 to 18 months, is called the holophrastic or one-word stage. Children begin to produce single words that represent entire phrases or sentences. For example, saying "milk" might mean "I want milk" or "There is milk."

Between 18 and 24 months, children enter the two-word stage, combining words to create basic phrases like "more cookie" or "daddy shoe." These combinations follow grammatical patterns despite their simplicity.

The telegraphic stage follows from age 2 to 3, where children speak in short, grammatically simplified sentences, often omitting function words like "the" or "is" but including the most meaningful content words.

Finally, from age 3 onwards, children begin to produce more complex grammatical structures, gradually mastering the intricacies of their native language. By age 5, most children can communicate effectively, though language development continues throughout childhood.

Research has shown that regardless of which language a child is learning, they progress through these stages in roughly the same order and at similar ages, suggesting that language acquisition is a universal process guided by innate capabilities.`,
